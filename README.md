## 4. Key Functionalities

1. Product Tracking
   - Record each step of a product's journey through the supply chain
   - Provide real-time updates on product location and status

2. Stakeholder Management
   - Register and manage different types of stakeholders
   - Calculate and update sustainability scores for stakeholders

3. Certification Verification
   - Record and verify various sustainability and ethical certifications
   - Link certifications to products and stakeholders

4. Sustainability Metrics Tracking
   - Record and monitor various sustainability metrics (e.g., carbon footprint, water usage)
   - Provide aggregated sustainability data for products and stakeholders

5. Blockchain Integration
   - Record critical supply chain events on the blockchain for immutability
   - Provide verification mechanism for data integrity

6. Analytics and Reporting
   - Generate comprehensive reports on product journeys
   - Provide insights on sustainability impact across the supply chain

7. Consumer Interface
   - Allow consumers to scan product codes to view the entire supply chain journey
   - Provide easy-to-understand sustainability scores and certifications

8. Alerts and Notifications
   - Send alerts for potential issues in the supply chain (e.g., delays, certification expiries)
   - Notify stakeholders about significant events or milestones

9. Data Visualization
   - Provide interactive dashboards for visualizing supply chain data
   - Offer map-based visualization of product journeys

10. API for Third-party Integration
